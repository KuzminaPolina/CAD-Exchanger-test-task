Development progress:
1. Create new project based on React + Vite + TypeScript;
2. Install Material UI
3. Install styled components
4. Install React Router.
5. Create basic website structure with two pages: Main and Contacts.
6. Configure React Router to switch between pages.
7. Made simple hader, nav + hero section
8. Researched libs to embed youtube video
9. Installed npm i react-player
10. Made 2 pages with basic style and layout.

11. Started working on the form page.
I contemplated using React Hook Form, but decided against it since it's a simple form and RHF might not be beneficial.
However, I previously used RHF in my other app, feel free to check it: [Scheduling app, form component](https://github.com/KuzminaPolina/scheduling-app/blob/main/frontend/src/components/LessonForm.tsx)
