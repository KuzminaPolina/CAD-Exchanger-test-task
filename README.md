# Project description
Test task for CADEX - an adaptive fullstack website for some company and its product.

## Frontend Setup
React+Vite, Typescript, MUI, styled-components

Other libraries: react-player for youtube video, react-router for navigation.

## Backend Setup
Node.js, Express

## Development
I should probably mention that this is my first project using MUI and styled-components, as well as creating backend. 
As a result, the styling is basic. I imagined this as a website for some software.
Ohter than that, I'm familar with React and Vite, and website hosting.
I contemplated using the React Hook Form for form validation, but decided against adding another package.
I used React Hook Form for validation in my other project, feel free to check it out: [Scheduling app, form component](https://github.com/KuzminaPolina/scheduling-app/blob/main/frontend/src/components/LessonForm.tsx).
I'll be happy to discuss this project on the interview.
Thank you for giving me a chance!
